## Introduction: 

I created this simple app on Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS as a coding test for a job interview. 

You can use it using by simply dropping the **indexcanvas2.html** file in to a browser window. You do not need to install/download anything. 

It does not use **npm server**

### Note:

It was my first JavaScript-based app. Hence the code is not of high quality. But it can easily be converted in a VueJS app or whatever framework you prefer.
